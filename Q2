You can create a **pandas Series** where the month's numbers are the data, and their names are the index values like this:

### **Python Code:**

```python
python
CopyEdit
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series with month numbers as data and month names as index
months = pd.Series(
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    index=['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June',
           'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
)

print(months)

```

### **Output:**

```
go
CopyEdit
January       1
February      2
March         3
April         4
May           5
June          6
July          7
August        8
September     9
October      10
November     11
December     12
dtype: int64

```

This creates a **Series** where the month names act as indexes, and their respective numbers are the values. ðŸš€
