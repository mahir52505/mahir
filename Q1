### **1️⃣ Lists**

You can create a Series from a **Python list**.

```python
python
CopyEdit
import pandas as pd

data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)

```

### **2️⃣ NumPy Arrays**

A Series can be created from a **NumPy array**.

```python
python
CopyEdit
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
series = pd.Series(arr)
print(series)

```

### **3️⃣ Dictionaries**

A Series can be created from a **dictionary**, where keys become the index.

```python
python
CopyEdit
data = {"a": 100, "b": 200, "c": 300}
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)

```

### **4️⃣ Scalar Values (Single Value Repeated)**

You can create a Series with a single repeated value.

```python
python
CopyEdit
series = pd.Series(5, index=[0, 1, 2, 3])
print(series)

```

### **5️⃣ Tuples**

A tuple can also be used to create a Series.

```python
python
CopyEdit
data = (10, 20, 30, 40)
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)

```

### **6️⃣ Pandas Series (Another Series as Input)**

You can create a new Series from an existing **pandas Series**.

```python
python
CopyEdit
old_series = pd.Series([5, 10, 15])
new_series = pd.Series(old_series)
print(new_series)

```

### **Key Takeaways:**

✅**Series can hold different data types**, including integers, floats, strings, and even mixed types.

✅ The **index** is automatically assigned but can be customized.

✅ Series is **mutable**, meaning values can be changed, but the size is **fixed**
