Here is a **Python program** that creates a **pandas Series** using a dictionary, where the batch groups (**MatMIE, MatDAIS, COMIE, COMEC**) are the index, and the number of students in each group are the values.

### **Python Code:**


import pandas as pd

# Creating a dictionary with batch groups and student numbers
students_dict = {
    'MatMIE': 45,
    'MatDAIS': 50,
    'COMIE': 40,
    'COMEC': 35
}

# Creating a pandas Series from the dictionary
students_series = pd.Series(students_dict)

# Displaying the Series
print(students_series)

```

### **Output:**

```
MatMIE    45
MatDAIS   50
COMIE     40
COMEC     35
dtype: int64

```

This **Series** stores the number of students in different fresh batch groups, with the batch names as **index** and the student count as **values**. ðŸš€
